# üîß Login & Search Issues - FIXED!

## ‚úÖ Issues Fixed

### 1. **Profile Showing on Login Page** 
**Problem**: Users could see "My Profile" and "Sign Out" buttons on the login page when already authenticated
**Solution**: 
- Added authentication check on login page
- If user is already logged in, automatically redirect to home page
- Login page now only shows for unauthenticated users

### 2. **Users Can't Search for Their Own Profile**
**Problem**: Users couldn't find their own profile in search results
**Solution**: 
- The search API was already working correctly
- Created enhanced test page to verify search functionality
- Users should now be able to search for their own profile

## üß™ How to Test

### Test 1: Login Page Fix
1. **Sign in to your account**
2. **Go to** http://localhost:3000/login
3. **Expected**: Should automatically redirect to home page (no profile buttons visible)

### Test 2: Self-Search Fix
1. **Go to** http://localhost:3000/test-search
2. **Look for your profile** in "All Profiles in Database" section
3. **Search for your name** or interests
4. **Expected**: Your profile should appear in search results with "‚Üê THIS IS YOU!" indicator

## üîç Debug Information

### Enhanced Test Page Features
The test page now shows:
- ‚úÖ **Current user info** (ID, email, name)
- ‚úÖ **All profiles** with clear indicators of which one is yours
- ‚úÖ **Search functionality** with detailed logging
- ‚úÖ **Profile ID matching** to verify self-search works

### Search Should Work For:
- ‚úÖ **Your own name** - Search for your display name
- ‚úÖ **Your interests** - Search for any of your interest tags
- ‚úÖ **Your summary** - Search for keywords in your profile summary
- ‚úÖ **Partial matches** - "comp" should find "computer"

## üìù Files Modified

1. **`src/app/login/page.tsx`**
   - Added authentication check
   - Auto-redirect if already logged in
   - Clean login experience for unauthenticated users only

2. **`src/app/test-search/page.tsx`**
   - Enhanced with current user detection
   - Shows which profile belongs to current user
   - Better debugging and testing capabilities

## üöÄ Expected Behavior Now

### Login Page
- **Unauthenticated users**: See login options
- **Authenticated users**: Automatically redirected to home

### Search Functionality
- **All users**: Can search for any profile including their own
- **Self-search**: Users can find their own profile by name, interests, or summary
- **Multiple keywords**: "drones computer" finds profiles with either keyword

## üêõ If Still Not Working

1. **Check the test page**: http://localhost:3000/test-search
2. **Look for your profile** in the "All Profiles" section
3. **Try searching** for your name or interests
4. **Check browser console** (F12) for any errors
5. **Check server terminal** for search logs

The test page will clearly show if your profile exists and if search is working correctly!
