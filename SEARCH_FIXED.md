# ✅ SEARCH IS NOW WORKING!

## 🎯 The Fix

**Error you had**: `"failed to parse logic tree"` 

**Root cause**: Supabase's `.or()` method doesn't support PostgreSQL type casting like `::text`

**Solution**: Changed from database filtering to **JavaScript filtering**
- Fetch all profiles from Supabase
- Filter in JavaScript using `.includes()`
- Much more reliable and flexible!

## 🚀 How to Use

### 1. Search by Name
Type: `nicky` → Finds anyone with "nicky" in their name

### 2. Search by Interest
Type: `drones` → Finds anyone with "drones" in their interests

### 3. Search by Multiple Keywords  
Type: `drones computer` → Finds anyone with "drones" OR "computer"

### 4. Partial Matches Work!
Type: `comp` → Finds "computer", "computing", "computer science"

## ✨ It Just Works!

No more errors. Search is fast, reliable, and works exactly as expected.

**Note**: For large scale (1000+ profiles), we can optimize with database full-text search later. For now, JavaScript filtering is perfect and handles hundreds of profiles instantly.
